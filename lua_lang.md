- Embeddable languages: In object code
- Extension languages
- Imperative languages
- Interactive mode languages
- Interpreted languages
- [Iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration) languages: are built around or offering [generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_programming)).
- Languages by memory management type: Garbage collected languages
- Metaprogramming languages
- Multiparadigm languages: Lua (functional, imperative, object-oriented (prototype-based))
- [Reflective Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_science)): let programs examine and possibly modify their high level structure at runtime or compile-time. 
- Scripting languages

### Embeddable languages: In object code
A wide variety of dynamic or scripting languages can be embedded in compiled executable code. Basically, object code for the language's [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) needs to be linked into the executable. Source code fragments for the embedded language can then be passed to an evaluation function as strings. Application control languages can be implemented this way, if the source code is input by the user. Languages with small interpreters are preferred.

- AngelScript
- Ch
- EEL
- Io
- Julia
- Lua
- MiniD
- Python
- Ruby (via mruby)
- Squirrel
- Tcl

### Extension languages
[Extension programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_programming_language) are languages embedded into another program and used to harness its features in extension scripts.

- AutoLISP (specific to AutoCAD)
- BeanShell
- CAL
- C/AL(C/SIDE)
- Guile
- Emacs Lisp
- JavaScript and some dialects (e.g. JScript)
- Lua – e.g. embedded in many games
- OpenCL – an extension of C and C++ to use the GPU and parallel extensions of the CPU
- OptimJ – an extension of the Java programming language with language support for writing optimization models and powerful abstractions for bulk data processing
- Perl
- Pike
- Python (embedded in Maya, Blender and other 3-D animation packages)
- REXX
- Ruby (Google SketchUp)
- S-Lang
- SQL
- Squirrel
- Tcl
- Vim script
- VBA
- Windows PowerShell

### Metaprogramming languages
[Metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) is the writing of programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data or that do part of the work that is otherwise done at [run time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase)) during [compile time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile_time). In many cases, this allows programmers to get more done in the same amount of time as they would take to write all the code manually.
