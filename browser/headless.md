# Headless Browser
> Is a web browser without a graphical user interface.
>
> Headless browsers provide automated control of a web page in an environment similar to popular web browsers, but are executed via a command-line interface or using network communication.
>
> They are particularly useful for testing web pages as they are able to render and understand HTML the same way a browser would, including execution of JavaScript and AJAX which are usually not available when using other testing methods.

### Headless browsers are used for:

- Test automation in modern web applications.
- Taking screenshots of web pages.
- Running automated tests for JavaScript libraries.
- Scraping web sites for data.
- Automating interaction of web pages.

### Advantage:
- Support for JS/AJAX interactions on page

### Disadvantage:
- Require the installed browser
- Need extra configuration
- Usually much slower than headless counterparts

## Examples:
### Headless mode
* [Google Chrome](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/05/chrome-59-beta-headless-chromium-native.html) - Headless mode is available  [on Linux and MacOS](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md#Usage-via-the-DevTools-remote-debugging-protocol) and Windows support came in Chrome 60.
* [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Headless_mode) – headless mode is available on linux, Windows and macOS since version 56, [usage](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/12/using-headless-mode-in-firefox/).
